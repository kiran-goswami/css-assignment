       what is css?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="text-decoration:line-through">Css is not neccesary</span> <span style="background-color:yellow">CSS saves a lot of work</span>.It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li>

    <h3>
        CSS can be added to html document in 3 ways:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using style element in the head section   </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file .</li>
        <li>The most comman way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files . However ,<span style="background-color:yellow"> in this
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles , </span> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it youurself .
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="test">
        When comparing to CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to miltiple elements.ID ,
        on the other hand applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to 
        link directly and it's used by javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="kiran">
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted , a style 
        can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="aira">
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to 
        which a style should be applied.
